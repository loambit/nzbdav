# Archives

NzbDAV can stream from inside **RAR** and **7z** archives, including many password-protected releases, without extracting the full archive to disk first.

Queue processing aggregates multi-volume sets and mounts the inner video (or other) files on the WebDAV tree. Lazy RAR parsing reduces work until content is needed. Nested RAR extraction and more resilient handling of obfuscated multi-volume sets [since 0.8.0](https://github.com/nzbdav/nzbdav/releases/tag/v0.8.0){ .nzbdav-since }.

If a release is archive-only and *Arr cannot import, check Automatic Queue Management rules and ignored-file globs under [SABnzbd settings](../configuration/sabnzbd.md).
