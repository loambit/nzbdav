## Set up your system

The project consists of two sub projects: frontend and backend
Both share some necessary environment variables.

**Ensure that frontend and backend share the same environment configuration!**

Environment variables:

```bash
export CONFIG_PATH=/where/to/create/database/
export FRONTEND_BACKEND_API_KEY=$(head -c 32 /dev/urandom | hexdump -ve '1/1 "%.2x"')
export BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

The backend thread-pool limits can optionally be overridden with
`THREADPOOL_MIN_THREADS` and `THREADPOOL_MAX_THREADS`. When unset, they retain
the production defaults of `max(2 × processor count, 50)` minimum threads and
`max(50 × processor count, 1000)` maximum threads.

You need some packages in order to run the project:

- dotnet-sdk
- aspnet-runtime
- nodejs
- npm

Example installation for Arch based systems:

```bash
sudo pacman -S dotnet-sdk aspnet-runtime nodejs npm
```

## Preferred local workflow

Use the helper scripts so the frontend and backend share env automatically:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — backend (builds, migrates, writes frontend/.env)
./scripts/run-backend.sh

# Terminal 2 — frontend (`predev` runs scripts/sync-dev-env.sh)
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```

`npm run dev` silently runs `scripts/sync-dev-env.sh` via the `predev` hook; if the API key drifts, restart the backend with `scripts/run-backend.sh`. The manual `dotnet publish` / env-var flow below remains supported.

`scripts/run-backend.sh` defaults `LOG_LEVEL=Debug` (and `LOG_BUFFER_SIZE=2000`, `STREAM_TRACE_EVENTS=20000`) when unset so local playback debugging is verbose. Docker/production leave these unset and keep Information-level logging.

Stream tracing is **opt-in**: it only runs when `STREAM_TRACE_EVENTS` is set to a positive value (the run script does this for local dev). When unset or `0` — the Docker/production default — no trace events are recorded and the trace APIs report `enabled: false`.

yEnc-decoding tests are skipped on platforms where the rapidyenc native library is unavailable (currently macOS arm64); they run in Linux CI.

## Real-provider playback testing

Use the two-process workflow above with a real Usenet provider (credentials stay in SQLite under `CONFIG_PATH`; never commit them).

1. Start backend + frontend (`./scripts/run-backend.sh`, then `cd frontend && npm run dev`).
2. Open `http://localhost:5173` → create the admin account if needed.
3. **Settings → Usenet** — add your provider (host, port, SSL, credentials, connections). Use Test connection / Benchmark if desired.
4. **Settings → WebDAV** — set a WebDAV username/password (required for rclone and most players).
5. Drop an `.nzb` on the Queue page and wait for it to mount.
6. Play via Explore / `/view/...`, or point rclone/VLC at the **frontend** proxy (`http://localhost:5173`), not the backend port directly.

Ports: UI `5173` → proxies WebDAV + `/api` → backend `5000`.

### Dumping a stream trace

While a file is playing, Overview → **Right now** shows a truncated session id (click to copy). After seeking/scrubbing:

```bash
# Latest active/recent session (or pass an explicit session id)
./scripts/dump-stream-trace.sh
./scripts/dump-stream-trace.sh <session-id>
```

Writes JSON under `swap/` (gitignored), including the correlated range/seek/segment/zero-fill timeline and a recent logs snapshot. Drop that file into chat for analysis. Traces are in-memory only — dump before restarting the backend.

## Build / run backend

The `NzbDav.UsenetSharp` dependency is published on NuGet.org and restores without
additional credentials.

```bash
cd backend

# Build (release)
dotnet publish -c Release -o ./publish

# Create database
mkdir -p $CONFIG_PATH
./publish/NzbWebDAV --db-migration

# Run backend
./publish/NzbWebDAV
```

## Build / serve frontend

Requires **Node.js 24+** (see `engines` in `frontend/package.json`).

`package.json` includes an `overrides` entry that pins `http-proxy-middleware` to the `http-proxy-node16` fork for Node compatibility. Remove it only after verifying proxy behavior against upstream `http-proxy`.

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run / serve frontend with hot module replacement
npm run dev
```

## Build Docker image

### Using Docker CLI

```bash
docker build .
```

You can also tag the release, which can be used with `docker compose`:

```bash
docker build -t example/nzbdav:test_build .
```

Run the container:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -v /path/to/nzbdav/config:/config \
  -e PUID=1000 \
  -e PGID=1000 \
  -p 3333:3000 \
  example/nzbdav:test_build
```

### Using Docker Compose

```yaml
services:
  nzbdav:
    build: .
    ports:
      - 3333:3000
    volumes:
      - /path/to/nzbdav/config:/config
      - /path/to/nzbdav/data:/data
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
```

Build and run container:

```bash
docker compose up
```
