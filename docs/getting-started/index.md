# Getting started

!!! note "Docs track latest"

    These pages describe the **latest** NzbDAV release. Features and settings marked with a [since 0.8.0](https://github.com/nzbdav/nzbdav/releases/tag/v0.8.0){ .nzbdav-since } pill (or similar) need at least that version — check your image tag or **Settings → About** before following a new workflow.

Choose a path based on where you are:

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-docker:{ .lg .middle } __Install with Docker__

    ---

    Persistent Compose deploy, health checks, reverse-proxy notes.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Docker](docker.md)

-   :material-swap-horizontal:{ .lg .middle } __Migrate from another build__

    ---

    Official path from nzbdav-dev `v0.6.4`, plus community forks (Pukabyte, NzbDavEx).

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Migration](migration.md)

-   :material-account-cog:{ .lg .middle } __First run__

    ---

    Admin account, Usenet provider, WebDAV credentials, import strategy.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: First run](first-run.md)

-   :material-sync:{ .lg .middle } __Connect *Arr__

    ---

    Add NzbDAV as a SABnzbd download client in Sonarr and Radarr.

-   :material-map:{ .lg .middle } __Understand the flow__

    ---

    How queue → mount → stream works with media servers.

## Prerequisites

1. **Usenet provider** — NNTP host, credentials, and connection allowance.
2. **Indexers** (optional for first play) — Newznab-compatible sources for search and *Arr.
3. **Docker** — Engine + Compose v2. Symlink imports also need Linux FUSE (`/dev/fuse`).

## Setup and hosting options

| Option | Who it’s for | Start here |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| **Self-hosted Docker** | You run Compose (or Unraid/etc.) and wire *Arr / rclone yourself | [Docker](docker.md) |
| **[DUMB](https://dumbarr.com/)** (Debrid Unlimited Media Bridge) | You want NzbDAV as a **fully supported core module** with guided onboarding and Arr wiring | [NzbDAV on dumbarr.com](https://dumbarr.com/services/core/nzbdav/) |

DUMB treats NzbDAV as a first-class Usenet WebDAV / SABnzbd-compatible workflow service (`core_service: nzbdav`), including automatic Arr download-client and symlink-path integration when you select it during onboarding. Prefer DUMB’s own docs for stack-specific paths and ports; use this site for NzbDAV Settings, features, and troubleshooting.

## After install
